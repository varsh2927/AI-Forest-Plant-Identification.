 AI-Powered Forest Plant Identification & Mapping

Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-driven bot that identifies plant species in forests using image recognition and maps their locations using GPS and GIS technology. It provides valuable insights for researchers, conservationists, and herbal medicine experts.

# Features
- Plant Species Recognition**: Uses AI-powered image classification to identify plants.
- Geolocation Mapping**: Logs GPS coordinates of identified plants.
- Data Collection & Storage**: Stores plant data for research and analysis.
- Mobile & Drone Integration**: Can be deployed on mobile devices or drones for large-scale scanning.

# Components
 1. AI-Based Plant Identification
- Trained on a dataset of plant images
- Uses **TensorFlow/Keras** for image classification
- Deploys on mobile devices or edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi)

 2. GPS & GIS Integration
- Captures latitude and longitude data
- Uses **Google Maps API / OpenStreetMap** for visualization
- Exports data as CSV/GeoJSON for analysis

 3. Data Storage & Access
- Stores plant data in a **MongoDB / Firebase** database
- Allows querying for plant species and locations

# Getting Started
 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
